## Getting Started


If you haven't used [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) before

Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web applications.

With Meteor you write apps:

in pure JavaScript
that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
using your choice of popular open-source libraries
Documentation is available at http://docs.meteor.com/

Install Meteor:

```shell
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
```
This system requires grunt-file-status https://github.com/wzalazar/grunt-file-status

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:wzalazar/meteor-file-status.git
```

Once the system has been installed, you have to install grunt-file-status

```shell
npm install grunt-file-status --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-file-status');
```
